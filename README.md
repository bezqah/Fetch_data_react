# dataFetch
Uses useEffect and useReduce to manage fetch of online data
These files go over the uses of the hook, useEffect, in react which allows the fetching of data from external servers which can then be added to a user's website or React component. These do not directly cause re-renders but can if state variables change during the process. UseEffect is designed to only run on the first render, but re-renders anytime there is a change to a specified variable. This code pulls data from Hacker News and displays it based on the user-entered query. It concludes with the data being paginated and the user able to define the amount of content on each page.
